Data Model Overview:
The first image illustrates a well-structured data model in Power BI, showing relationships between different tables like Customer_Lookup, Product_Lookup, Store_Lookup, Calendar_Lookup, and Transactions. 
This model enables detailed analysis by linking key dimensions (such as products, customers, and stores) with transaction data, providing the foundation for insightful reporting.

Retail Sales Dashboard:
The second image depicts a dynamic retail sales dashboard, summarizing key performance metrics such as total sales, profit, returns, and average sales per store. 
Visual elements like bar charts, pie charts, and geographical maps enhance data visualization, making it easy to track performance across regions, stores, brands, and products.

I will be adding more visualizations here that I will work on enhancing my Power BI knowledge.
